Your distribution may have packaged `ncspot` in its package repository.
If so, simply install using your distribution's package manager - it
is by far the easiest way. If not, you can build from source instead.
See [Compiling](/doc/developers.md).

In case your package manager does not perform dependency resolution,
here are the runtime dependencies:

- `dbus`, `libncurses`, `libssl`
- `libpulse` (or `portaudio`, if built using the PortAudio backend)
- `libxcb` (if built with the `clipboard` feature)
- `ueberzug` or a compatible implementation (e.g. `ueberzugpp`) (if built with the `cover` feature)

### On BSD's
Your distribution may have packaged `ncspot` in its package repository.
If so, simply install using your distribution's package manager - it
is by far the easiest way. If not, you can build from source instead.
See [Compiling](/doc/developers.md).

### From [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ncspot)

`ncspot` can be installed with `cargo`. The `cargo` documentation recommends against installing
software with it. If another option is available from the ones above, it should be preferred. If no
recent version is available for your OS, you can use the following command to install `ncspot` from
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ncspot).

```zsh
# The --locked option is important and the compilation process might fail without it
cargo install --locked ncspot
```

## Key Bindings
The keybindings listed below are configured by default. Additionally, if you
built `ncspot` with MPRIS support, you may be able to use media keys to control
playback depending on your desktop environment settings. Have a look at the
[configuration section](#configuration) if you want to set custom bindings.

## Remote control (IPC)
Apart from MPRIS, ncspot will also create a domain socket on UNIX platforms (Linux, macOS, *BSD).
The socket will be created in the platform's runtime directory. If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is set, it will
be created under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ncspot`. If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR isn't set, it will be created under
`/run/user/<uid>` for Linux if it exists. In all other cases, it will be created under
`/tmp/ncspot-<uid>`. Applications or scripts can connect to this socket to send commands or be
notified of the currently playing track, i.e. with `netcat`:

```
% nc -U ~/.cache/ncspot/ncspot.sock
play
{"mode":{"Playing":{"secs_since_epoch":1672249086,"nanos_since_epoch":547517730}},"playable":{"type":"Track","id":"2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","uri":"spotify:track:2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","title":"Hit Me Where It Hurts","track_number":4,"disc_number":1,"duration":184132,"artists":["Caroline Polachek"],"artist_ids":["4Ge8xMJNwt6EEXOzVXju9a"],"album":"Pang","album_id":"4ClyeVlAKJJViIyfVW0yQD","album_artists":["Caroline Polachek"],"cover_url":"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737d983e7bf67c2806218c2759","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","added_at":"2022-12-19T22:41:05Z","list_index":0}}
playpause
{"mode":{"Paused":{"secs":25,"nanos":575000000}},"playable":{"type":"Track","id":"2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","uri":"spotify:track:2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","title":"Hit Me Where It Hurts","track_number":4,"disc_number":1,"duration":184132,"artists":["Caroline Polachek"],"artist_ids":["4Ge8xMJNwt6EEXOzVXju9a"],"album":"Pang","album_id":"4ClyeVlAKJJViIyfVW0yQD","album_artists":["Caroline Polachek"],"cover_url":"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737d983e7bf67c2806218c2759","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2wcrQZ7ZJolYEfIaPP9yL4","added_at":"2022-12-19T22:41:05Z","list_index":0}}
```

Each time the playback status changes (i.e. after sending the `play`/`playpause`
command or simply by playing the queue), the current status will be published as
a JSON structure.

Possible use cases for this could be:
- Controlling a detached ncspot session (in `tmux` for example)
- Displaying the currently playing track in your favorite application/status bar (see below)
- Setting up routines, i.e. to play specific songs/playlists when ncspot starts

### Extracting info on currently playing song
Using `netcat` and the domain socket, you can query the currently playing track
and other relevant information. Note that not all `netcat` versions are suitable,
as they typically tend to keep the connection to the socket open. OpenBSD's
`netcat` offers a work-around: by using the `-W` flag, it will close after a
specific number of packets have been received.

```
% nc -W 1 -U ~/.cache/ncspot/ncspot.sock
{"mode":{"Playing":{"secs_since_epoch":1675188934,"nanos_since_epoch":50913345}},"playable":{"type":"Track","id":"5Cp6a1h2VnuOtsh1Nqxfv6","uri":"spotify:track:5Cp6a1h2VnuOtsh1Nqxfv6","title":"New Track","track_number":1,"disc_number":1,"duration":498358,"artists":["Francis Bebey"],"artist_ids":["0mdmrbu5UZ32uRcRp2z6mr"],"album":"African Electronic Music (1975-1982)","album_id":"7w99Aae1tYSTSb1OiDnxYY","album_artists":["Francis Bebey"],"cover_url":"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736ab57cedf27177fae1eaed87","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5Cp6a1h2VnuOtsh1Nqxfv6","added_at":"2020-12-22T09:57:17Z","list_index":0}}
```

This results in a single output in `JSON` format, which can e.g. be parsed using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
For example, you can get the currently playing artist and title in your
terminal as follows:

```
% nc -W 1 -U ~/.cache/ncspot/ncspot.sock | jq '.playable.title'
"PUMPIN' JUMPIN'"

% nc -W 1 -U ~/.cache/ncspot/ncspot.sock | jq '.playable.artists[0]'
"Hideki Naganuma"
```

## Configuration
Configuration is saved to `~/.config/ncspot/config.toml` (or
`%AppData%\ncspot\config.toml` on Windows). To reload the configuration during
runtime use the `reload` command.

Possible configuration values are:

1. If built with the `cover` feature.
2. By default the statusbar will show a play icon when a track is playing and
   a pause icon when playback is stopped. If this setting is enabled, the behavior
   is reversed.
3. Run `ncspot -h` for a list of devices.
4. If built with the `notify` feature.

### Custom Keybindings
Keybindings can be configured in `[keybindings]` section in `config.toml`.

Each key-value pair specifies one keybinding, where the key is a string in the
format of:

```
[MODIFIER+]<CHAR|NAMED_KEY>
where:
  MODIFIER: Shift|Alt|Ctrl
  CHAR: Any printable character
  NAMED_KEY: Enter|Space|Tab|Backspace|Esc|Left|Right|Up|Down
    |Ins|Del|Home|End|PageUp|PageDown|PauseBreak|NumpadCenter
    |F0|F1|F2|F3|F4|F5|F6|F7|F8|F9|F10|F11|F12
```

For implementation see [commands::CommandManager::parse_key](/src/commands.rs).

Its value is a string that can be parsed as a command. See
[Vim-Like Commands](#vim-like-commands).

<details>
  <summary>Examples: (Click to show/hide)</summary>

```toml
[keybindings]
# Bind "Shift+i" to "Seek forward 10 seconds"
"Shift+i" = "seek +10s"
```

To disable a default keybinding, set its command to `noop`:

```toml
# Use "Shift+q" to quit instead of the default "q"
[keybindings]
"Shift+q" = "quit"
"q" = "noop"
```

</details>

### Proxy
`ncspot` will respect system proxy settings defined via the `http_proxy`
environment variable.

```sh
# In sh-like shells
http_proxy="http://foo.bar:4444" ncspot
```

### Theming
[Theme generator](https://ncspot-theme-generator.vaa.red/) by [@vaarad](https://github.com/vaared).

The color palette can be modified in the configuration. For instance, to have
`ncspot` match Spotify's official client, you can add the following entries to
the configuration file:

```toml
[theme]
background = "black"
primary = "light white"
secondary = "light black"
title = "green"
playing = "green"
playing_selected = "light green"
playing_bg = "black"
highlight = "light white"
highlight_bg = "#484848"
error = "light white"
error_bg = "red"
statusbar = "black"
statusbar_progress = "green"
statusbar_bg = "green"
cmdline = "light white"
cmdline_bg = "black"
search_match = "light red"
```

More examples can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/pull/40).

### Track Formatting
It's possible to customize how tracks are shown in Queue/Library views and the
statusbar, whereas `statusbar_format` will hold the statusbar formatting and
`[track_format]` the formatting for tracks in list views.
If you don't define `center` for example, the default value will be used.
Available options for tracks: `%artists`, `%title`, `%album`, `%saved`,
`%duration`

Default configuration:

```toml
statusbar_format = "%artists - %title"

[track_format]
left = "%artists - %title"
center = "%album"
right = "%saved %duration"
```

<details>
  <summary>Examples: (Click to show/hide)</summary>

Example 1 - Show only album name and track name after it:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%album"
center = "%title"
right = ""
```

Example 2 - Show track title before artists, and don't show album at all:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%title - %artists"
center = ""
```

Example 3 - Show everything as default, but hide saved status and track length:

```toml
[track_format]
right = ""
```

Example 4 - Show everything as default, except show title before artists:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%title - %artists"
```

Example 5 - Show saved status and duration first, followed by track title and artists, with the album last:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "|%saved| %duration | %title - %artists"
center = ""
right = "%album"
```

</details>

### Notification Formatting
`ncspot` also supports customizing the way notifications are displayed
(which appear when compiled with the `notify` feature and `notify = true`).
The title and body of the notification can be set, with `title` and `body`, or the default will be used.
The formatting options are the same as those for [track formatting](#track-formatting) (`%artists`, `%title`, etc)

Default configuration:

```toml
[notification_format]
title = "%title"
body = "%artists"
```

### Cover Drawing
When compiled with the `cover` feature, `ncspot` can draw the album art of the
current track in a dedicated view (`:focus cover` or <kbd>F8</kbd> by default)
using Überzug. The original project has been abandoned, therefore using a
compatible implementation such as [Überzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp)
is recommended. For more information on installation and terminal
compatibility, consult that repository.

To allow scaling up the album art beyond its native resolution (640x640 for
Spotify covers), use the config key `cover_max_scale`. This is especially useful
for HiDPI displays:

```toml
cover_max_scale = 2
```

## Authentication
`ncspot` prompts for a Spotify username and password on first launch, uses this
to generate an OAuth token, and stores it to disk.

The credentials are stored in `~/.cache/ncspot/librespot/credentials.json`
(unless the base path has been changed with the `--basepath` option).

The `logout` command can be used to remove cached credentials. See
[Vim-Like Commands](#vim-like-commands).

### Using a Password Manager
If you would like ncspot to retrieve your login data from command results,
i.e. because you use a password manager like `pass`, you can add the following
configuration:

```toml
[credentials]
username_cmd = "echo username"
password_cmd = "pass spotify.com/username"
```

Do note that this is only required for the initial login or when your credential
token has expired.
