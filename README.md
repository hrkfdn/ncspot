`ncspot` is a ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using `librespot`. It is
heavily inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc. My motivation was to
provide a simple and resource friendly alternative to the official client as
well as to support platforms that currently don't have a Spotify client, such
as the \*BSDs.

Note that `ncspot` offers features that are legally incompatible with free Spotify
accounts. See [feature comparison](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/premium-plans/)
and [Spotify user guidelines](https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/user-guidelines/).
You **must** have an existing premium Spotify subscription to use `ncspot`.

## Resource Footprint Comparison

Measured using `ps_mem` on Linux during playback:

| Client  | Private Memory | Shared Memory | Total      |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| ncspot  | 22.1 MiB       | 24.1 MiB      | 46.2 MiB   |
| Spotify | 407.3 MiB      | 592.7 MiB     | 1000.0 MiB |

## Installation

### On macOS

`ncspot` is available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```zsh
brew install ncspot
```

### On Windows

`ncspot` is available via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```powershell
scoop install ncspot
```

### On Linux

Your distribution may have packaged `ncspot` in its package repository.
If so, simply install using your distribution's package manager - it
is by far the easiest way. If not, you can build from source instead.
See [Build](#build).

In case your package manager does not perform dependency resolution,
here are the runtime dependencies:

- `dbus`, `libncurses`, `libssl`
- `libpulse` (or `portaudio`, if built using the PortAudio backend)
- `libxcb` (if built with the `clipboard` feature)
- `ueberzug` (if built with the `cover` feature)

## Build

### Prerequisites

- A working [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Python 3 (needed for building `rust-xcb` dependency)

On Linux, you also need:

- `pkgconf` (or `pkg-config`)
- Development headers for the [aforementioned runtime dependencies](#on-linux)
  - Debian and derivatives:
    ```sh
    sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev libncursesw5-dev libpulse-dev libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
    ```
  - Fedora:
    ```sh
    sudo dnf install dbus-devel libxcb-devel ncurses-devel openssl-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel
    ```
  - Arch and derivatives:
    ```sh
    # headers are included in the base packages
    sudo pacman -S dbus libpulse libxcb ncurses openssl
    ```

### Debugging

For debugging, you can pass a debug log filename:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run -- -d debug.log
```

If ncspot has crashed you can find the latest backtrace at `~/.cache/ncspot/backtrace.log`.

### Compiling

Compile and install the latest release with `cargo-install`:

```sh
cargo install ncspot
```

Or clone and build locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot
cargo build --release
```

**You may need to manually set the audio backend on non-Linux OSes.** See
[Audio Backends](#audio-backends).

#### Building a Debian Package

You can also use `cargo-deb` to build a Debian package

```sh
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
```

You can find the package under `target/debian`.

### Audio Backends

By default `ncspot` is built using the PulseAudio backend. To make it use the
PortAudio backend (e.g. for \*BSD or macOS) or Rodio backend (e.g. for
Windows), you need to compile `ncspot` with the respective features:

```sh
# PortAudio (BSD/macOS)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features portaudio_backend,pancurses_backend

# Rodio (Windows)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features rodio_backend,pancurses_backend
```

### Other Features

Here are some auxiliary features you may wish to enable:

| Feature           | Default | Description                                                                                |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cover`           | off     | Add a screen to show the album art. See [Cover Drawing](#cover-drawing).                   |
| `mpris`           | on      | Control `ncspot` via dbus. See [Arch Wiki: MPRIS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS). |
| `notify`          | on      | Send a notification to show what's playing.                                                |
| `share_clipboard` | on      | Ability to copy the URL of a song/playlist/etc. to system clipboard.                       |

Consult [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) for the full list of supported features.

## Key Bindings

The keybindings listed below are configured by default. Additionally, if you
built `ncspot` with MPRIS support, you may be able to use media keys to control
playback depending on your desktop environment settings. Have a look at the
[configuration section](#configuration) if you want to set custom bindings.

## Configuration

Configuration is saved to `~/.config/ncspot/config.toml` (or
`%AppData%\ncspot\config.toml` on Windows). To reload the configuration during
runtime use the `reload` command.

1. If built with the `cover` feature.
2. By default the statusbar will show a play icon when a track is playing and
   a pause icon when playback is stopped. If this setting is enabled, the behavior
   is reversed.
3. Run `ncspot -h` for a list of devices.
4. If built with the `notify` feature.

### Custom Keybindings

Keybindings can be configured in `[keybindings]` section in `config.toml`.

Each key-value pair specifies one keybinding, where the key is a string in the
format of:

```
[MODIFIER+]<CHAR|NAMED_KEY>
where:
  MODIFIER: Shift|Alt|Ctrl
  CHAR: Any printable character
  NAMED_KEY: Enter|Space|Tab|Backspace|Esc|Left|Right|Up|Down
    |Ins|Del|Home|End|PageUp|PageDown|PauseBreak|NumpadCenter
    |F0|F1|F2|F3|F4|F5|F6|F7|F8|F9|F10|F11|F12
```

For implementation see [commands::CommandManager::parse_key](/src/commands.rs).

Its value is a string that can be parsed as a command. See
[Vim-Like Commands](#vim-like-commands).

<details>
  <summary>Examples: (Click to show/hide)</summary>

```toml
[keybindings]
# Bind "Shift+i" to "Seek forward 10 seconds"
"Shift+i" = "seek +10s"
```

To disable a default keybinding, set its command to `noop`:

```toml
# Use "Shift+q" to quit instead of the default "q"
[keybindings]
"Shift+q" = "quit"
"q" = "noop"
```

</details>

### Proxy

`ncspot` will respect system proxy settings defined via the `http_proxy`
environment variable.

```sh
# In sh-like shells
http_proxy="http://foo.bar:4444" ncspot
```

### Theming

[Theme generator](https://ncspot-theme-generator.vaa.red/) by [@vaarad](https://github.com/vaared).

The color palette can be modified in the configuration. For instance, to have
`ncspot` match Spotify's official client, you can add the following entries to
the configuration file:

```toml
[theme]
background = "black"
primary = "light white"
secondary = "light black"
title = "green"
playing = "green"
playing_selected = "light green"
playing_bg = "black"
highlight = "light white"
highlight_bg = "#484848"
error = "light white"
error_bg = "red"
statusbar = "black"
statusbar_progress = "green"
statusbar_bg = "green"
cmdline = "light white"
cmdline_bg = "black"
search_match = "light red"
```

More examples can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/pull/40).

### Track Formatting

It's possible to customize how tracks are shown in Queue/Library views and the
statusbar, whereas `statusbar_format` will hold the statusbar formatting and
`[track_format]` the formatting for tracks in list views.
If you don't define `center` for example, the default value will be used.
Available options for tracks: `%artists`, `%title`, `%album`, `%saved`,
`%duration`

Default configuration:

```toml
statusbar_format = "%artists - %title"

[track_format]
left = "%artists - %title"
center = "%album"
right = "%saved %duration"
```

<details>
  <summary>Examples: (Click to show/hide)</summary>

Example 1 - Show only album name and track name after it:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%album"
center = "%title"
right = ""
```

Example 2 - Show track title before artists, and don't show album at all:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%title - %artists"
center = ""
```

Example 3 - Show everything as default, but hide saved status and track length:

```toml
[track_format]
right = ""
```

Example 4 - Show everything as default, except show title before artists:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "%title - %artists"
```

Example 5 - Show saved status and duration first, followed by track title and artists, with the album last:

```toml
[track_format]
left = "|%saved| %duration | %title - %artists"
center = ""
right = "%album"
```

</details>

### Notification Formatting

`ncspot` also supports customizing the way notifications are displayed
(which appear when compiled with the `notify` feature and `notify = true`).
The title and body of the notification can be set, with `title` and `body`, or the default will be used.
The formatting options are the same as those for [track formatting](#track-formatting) (`%artists`, `%title`, etc)

Default configuration:

```toml
[notification_format]
title = "%title"
body = "%artists"
```

## Cover Drawing

When compiled with the `cover` feature, `ncspot` can draw the album art of the
current track in a dedicated view (`:focus cover` or <kbd>F8</kbd> by default)
using [Überzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug). For more information on
installation and terminal compatibility, consult that repository.

To allow scaling up the album art beyond its native resolution (640x640 for
Spotify covers), use the config key `cover_max_scale`. This is especially useful
for HiDPI displays:

```toml
cover_max_scale = 2
```

## Authentication

`ncspot` prompts for a Spotify username and password on first launch, uses this
to generate an OAuth token, and stores it to disk.

The credentials are stored in `~/.cache/ncspot/librespot/credentials.json`
(unless the base path has been changed with the `--basepath` option).

The `logout` command can be used to remove cached credentials. See
[Vim-Like Commands](#vim-like-commands).
