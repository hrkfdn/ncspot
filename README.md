ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using librespot. It is heavily inspired
by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc.  My motivation was to provide a simple
and resource friendly alternative to the official client as well as to support
platforms that currently don't have a Spotify client, such as the *BSDs.

## Resource footprint comparison

Measured using `ps_mem` on Linux during playback:

| Client | Private Memory | Shared Memory | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ncspot | 22.1 MiB | 24.1 MiB | 46.2 MiB |
| Spotify | 407.3 MiB | 592.7 MiB | 1000.0 MiB |

## Requirements

* Rust
* Python 3 (needed for building `rust-xcb` dependency)
* `libpulse-dev` (or `portaudio-dev`, if you want to use the PortAudio backend)
* `libncurses-dev` and `libssl-dev`
* `libdbus-1-dev`
* `libxcb` + development headers (for clipboard access)
* A Spotify premium account
* pkg-config

On Debian based systems you need following packages for `libxcb` developement headers:
```
sudo apt install libpulse-dev libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```


## Usage

* Install the latest ncspot release using `cargo install ncspot`
  * or build it yourself using `cargo build --release`
  * both approaches require a working [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* For debugging, pass a debug log filename, e.g. `ncspot -d debug.log`

## Audio backends

By default ncspot is built using the Rodio backend.  To make it use the
PortAudio backend (e.g. for *BSD or macOS), you need to recompile ncspot with
the `portaudio_backend` feature:

* `cargo run --no-default-features --features
  portaudio_backend,cursive/pancurses-backend`

### Key Bindings

These keybindings are hardcoded for now. In the future it may be desirable to
have them configurable.

* `?` show help screen
* Navigate through the screens using the F-keys:
  * `F1`: Queue
    * `c` clears the entire queue
    * `d` deletes the currently selected track
    * `Ctrl-s` opens a dialog to save the queue to a playlist
  * `F2`: Search
  * `F3`: Library
    * `d` deletes the currently selected playlist
* Tracks and playlists can be played using `Return` and queued using `Space`
* `s` will save, `d` will remove the currently selected track to/from your
  library
* `o` will open a detail view or context menu for the selected item
* `Shift-o` will open a context menu for the currently playing track
* `a` will open the album view for the selected item
* `A` will open the artist view for the selected item
* `Backspace` closes the current view
* `Shift-p` toggles playback of a track
* `Shift-s` stops a track
* `Shift-u` updates the library cache (tracks, artists, albums, playlists)
* `<` and `>` play the previous or next track
* `f` and `b` to seek forward or backward
* `Shift-f` and `Shift-b` to seek forward or backward in steps of 10s
* `-` and `+` decrease or increase the volume
* `r` to toggle repeat mode
* `z` to toggle shuffle playback
* `q` quits ncspot
* `x` copies a sharable URL of the song to the system clipboard
* `Shift-x` copies a sharable URL of the currently selected item to the system clipboard

You can also open a Vim style commandprompt using `:`, the following commands
are supported:

* `quit`: Quit ncspot
* `toggle`: Toggle playback
* `stop`: Stop playback
* `previous`/`next`: Play previous/next track
* `clear`: Clear playlist
* `share [current | selected]`: Copies a sharable URL of either the selected item or the currernt song to the system clipboard

The screens can be opened with `queue`, `search`, `playlists` and `log`, whereas
`search` can be supplied with a search term that will be entered after opening
the search view.

## Configuration

Configuration is saved to `~/.config/ncspot/config.toml`. Possible configuration
values are:

* `use_nerdfont`: Turn nerdfont glyphs on/off <true/false>
* `theme`: Set a custom color palette (see below)

Keybindings can be configured in `[keybindings]` section in `config.toml`, e.g. as such:

```
[keybindings]
"Shift+i" = "seek +10000"
```

See the help screen by pressing `?` for a list of possible commands.

ncspot will respect system proxy settings defined via the `http_proxy`
environment variable.

### Theming

The color palette can be modified in the configuration. For instance, to have
ncspot match Spotify's official client, you can add the following entries to the
configuration file:

```
[theme]
background = "black"
primary = "light white"
secondary = "light black"
title = "green"
playing = "green"
playing_bg = "black"
highlight = "light white"
highlight_bg = "#484848"
error = "light white"
error_bg = "red"
statusbar = "black"
statusbar_progress = "green"
statusbar_bg = "green"
cmdline = "light white"
cmdline_bg = "black"
```
